## A.2) User Stories:

### 1. As a teacher, I want to be able to distinguish types of messages within the chat, so that I can identify time sensitive information from general messages. 

Design Explanation: For this user story, our team decided that the best way to distinguish different types of messages would be by highlighting the color of the background of the message. We decided on three different types of main messages: questions, highlighted in red, answers, highlighted in blue, and general comments, with no highlighted background. We decided on using color for two main reasons. Firstly, color was the best way to distinguish messages without reducing the readability of the message. Secondly, color has strong emotional connections. For example, we highlighted questions in red. Questions are typically going to be the most important messages that teachers will look for in the chat, and the color red is typically associated with urgency, or warning, which will cause the teacher’s attention to immediately switch over to the question.

### 2. As a teacher, I want the ability to share interactive presentations with my students, so that I can keep them engaged with the presentation.

Design Explanation: For this user story, our team decided that the best way to increase interactivity and engagement with students would be to implement a “White Board Mode” in Zoom. This mode allows for both teachers and students to have an interactive area that they can perform classroom activities in. This can be solving math problems where students can show their work, drawing a picture, or playing games. By having the students do more activities other than listening to the teacher, they will be more engaged with the content, have a better learning experience, and have increased interactivity with the classroom.

### 3. As a teacher, I want to be able to view all students screens’ (video or image) during a breakout session, so that I can see which groups/individuals are engaged and on task.

Design Explanation:  For this user story our team decided that each breakout room needed to be immediately visible to teachers along with the individual students in them. We decided to separate the rooms into desk-like clusters similar to simulate the physicality of a real classroom. The shape and size can change dynamically, but they will always appear as separate clusters. Additionally we added colored borders to each group so teachers would have more visual cues to better recognize and remember which students were in which group. Teachers can also mute/unmute groups from the main screen or click on the group to display its members. This gives teachers much more control over breakout rooms and allows them to quickly shift and divide their attention as needed to aid their students.

### 4. As an elementary-aged student, I want to be able to easily learn and use Zoom’s meeting features, so that I can communicate with my teacher and peers without my parents’ help.

Design Explanation:  For this user story our team decided that there are a few ways to make Zoom’s features more accessible and easier to understand for younger users.  These are either new features that are not included in the current version or they are updates of current features.  The changes made include removing features that younger users wouldn’t need, leaving the navigation bar fixed on the screen, assigning the functions colors, and adding simpler signifiers when hovering over a function.  The main features that can be distinguished in the video are the reduced number of buttons or options for users to choose from, the new color coded buttons so that it is easier for students with limited literacy to find and use buttons, and the newer hover messages. The color palette is also accessible to those with color deficiencies. By simplifying the interface and providing students with more than one way to identify a function the usability is enhanced and is more accessible for a broader range of young students.

### 5. As an elementary-aged student, I want to interact with Zoom through mouse inputs, so that I am not forced to use the keyboard if I cannot type.

Design Explanation: For this user story, our team decided that the best alternative to keyboard input is speech-to-text and raising a hand. The button that activates speech-to-text consists of a symbol and label, and it is located in the chat window, right above the textbox that takes in keyboard input. These design choices were made for fast discoverability and learnability of the new feature. Once activated, a visual feedback of voice converting into text is displayed in adaptive font size, which allows faster learnability of the feature. We also decided to add alternative pathways such as re-do, done, and close, to give the students more control over handling user errors. The buttons to access these pathways are color-coded to help the students distinguish their roles. 
For raising a hand, we decided to relocate the existing feature to the navigation bar for faster discoverability and efficiency. To be consistent with the other buttons in the navigation bar, the button for this feature has a unique color and consists of a representative icon and label. Students can voluntarily lower their hand by clicking the button again, which can also resolve accidental hand-raising.

### 6. As an elementary-aged student, I want the ability to pick an image/icon to appear next to my name, so I can easily identify myself and others in the Zoom meeting.

Design Explanation: For this user story our team decided to create an option for students to choose an icon to place next to their name to distinguish themselves from others. This feature is implemented as a clickable drop down button next to the students name with a list of pre-approved icons. Our design for this is not overly bloated and is simple to operate as to not confuse or distract the student.
